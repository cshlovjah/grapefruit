### GrapeFruit Game Engine

The game engine that powers [lttp-webgl](https://github.com/englercj/lttp-webgl), and the soon to come _Mana_.

The goal of this project is for users to be able to make a game with minimal programming and judicious use 
of the [Tiled Map Editor](http://mapeditor.org).

## Dependencies

These dependencies are required for the Engine to work properly, but are not packaged with the Engine itself. They should be removed
as dependencies, or packaged with it.

* [Three.js r54+](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)

## Current State

This project is under heavy development, and the API is subject to change at any time. Check the GitHub issue list
to see what is needed to reach `v0.1.0`, the first unstable release.
