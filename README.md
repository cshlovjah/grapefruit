### GrapeFruit Game Engine

The game engine that powers lttp-webgl

## Dependencies

These dependencies are required for the Engine to work properly, but are not packaged with the Engine itself. They should be removed
as dependencies, or packaged with it (jquery can be removed with some refactoring, the others not so easily).
